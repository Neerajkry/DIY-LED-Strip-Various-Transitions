# DIY-LED-Strip-Various-Transitions
On Festivals like Diwali or Christmas, we often see LED strips blinking in different patterns. Sometimes in one direction some times slow etc. Well, it can be done using Arduino. 
Hardware required here will be :
- Arduino Board
- LED Strip
- Push Button
- Connecting Wires
Note: In the logic with the help of which this project is done, the total number of LED's are known. As there are certain patterns which can only be created if the developer knows the exact no. of LED's are present in the LED Strip. Also, this Mini-project is done on Proteus. Due to pandamic(COVID-19), it was not possible to have the hardware and electronics in real.GOOD LUCK!!
